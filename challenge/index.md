# Workflow
* We didn't know if this was a Driver/Navigator exercise to start so we
went Solo but with Wesley sharing his screen.
* I personally, got stuck with the initial `git clone` as I created a directory
prematurely. I felt I was in a rush, and I need to slow down and read the
directions a little closer.
* Wesley did a good job talking through what he was doing, and since he was
ahead of me I let him do the "navigating".
